            'comment': 'Copper fungicides are the most commonly recommended treatment for bacterial leaf spot. Use copper fungicide as a preventive measure after you’ve planted your seeds but before you’ve moved the plants into their permanent homes. You can use copper fungicide spray before or after a rain, but don’t treat with copper fungicide while it is raining. If you’re seeing signs of bacterial leaf spot, spray with copper fungicide for a seven- to 10-day period, then spray again for one week after plants are moved into the field. Perform maintenance treatments every 10 days in dry weather and every five to seven days in rainy weather.',
